# Auditing a concept's history

The concept store keeps a record of every change made to a concept. This is useful for tracking down errors, understanding why a concept was changed, or reverting to a previous version. You can view the history of a concept by clicking the `View history` button on the right hand side of the concept page.

Each edit comes with a summary of the changes made, the user who made the change, and the time the change was made.

## Viewing a specific revision

To view a specific version of a concept, click the date of the revision you want to view. This will take you to a read-only version of the concept at that point in time.

## Undoing an individual change

To undo a change, find the change you want to revert to in the list, and click the `undo` button next to it. The changes from that edit will be removed from the concept. This is a partial undo, and will not remove any changes made in subsequent edits.

## Restoring a previous version

To restore a previous version of a concept, find the version you want to restore in the list, and click the `restore` button next to it. A new revision of the concept with the same content as the version you selected will be created.

Undoing or restoring a previous version will create a new revision of the concept. This will be recorded in the history, and can itself be undone in the same way.

## Comparing versions

To compare two versions of a concept, select two versions from the list and click the `compare selected revisions` button. You'll see a side-by-side list of additions and deletions between the two versions, with the user who made the changes.

You can use the `Browse history interactively` tool to scrub between versions and see how the concept has changed over time.
