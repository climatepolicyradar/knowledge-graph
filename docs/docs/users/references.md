# Supporting your work with references

References are URLs to reliable sources that support the statements in the concept store. They can be added to any statement in the concept store, and can also be added to the item itself.

[The Reference property](https://climatepolicyradar.wikibase.cloud/wiki/Property:P4) behaves like any other property in the concept store.

## Statement references

Statements or claims about concepts can be supported by references. References are URLs to reliable sources that support the statement. They can be added to any statement in the concept store.

Each statement can be supported by an optional reference. The value should be a URL to a reliable source that supports the statement. That might be something direct and formal (eg a scientific paper, a news article, a government report), or indirect (eg a conversation on slack, or a page in notion). As long as the reference offers sufficient explanation for why a decision was made, it's a good reference.

To add a reference, click the `+ add reference` button on the right hand side of the statement you want to reference. You'll be prompted to choose a property type (start typing `Reference` to find the property), and then to enter the URL of the reference. Click `âœ… save` to save your changes.

You can add multiple references to a single statement by clicking the `+ add reference` button again and following the same process.

## Item references

Reference properties can also be added to the item itself. This is useful when you want to provide a general reference for the concept, rather than a specific statement. To add a reference to an item, click the `+ add statement` button in the bottom right hand corner of the item content, and follow the same process as above.
