# Idealised workflow

TODO: clearer navigation instructions for new users

This is a guide to an idealised workflow for the concept store. It's based on [some notes by Sarah](https://www.notion.so/climatepolicyradar/Policy-workflow-in-concept-store-10fbda2795e44ba08a07a555ef5deb45?pvs=4), and adapted for the working concept store. As the workflow evolves, this document should be updated to reflect the new process!

- A policy team member would make additions to the concept store based on their research:
  - At each stage, search the concept store to check check whether the concepts to be created already exist
    - Find or create a new concept “parent” (e.g. `Just transition`) with a description and a set of alternative labels. This concept should be as high-level as possible, and should be a good starting point for a new field.
    - Find or create subconcepts linked to the parent concepts (e.g. `Green jobs` are a `Subconcept of` `Just transition`)
    - Continue to build out the hierarchy of concepts, and add non-hierarchical relationships as needed
    - Check for typos or human error before submitting to the store
- The Head of Policy / appropriate team member would edit the concept to ensure it is accurate and complete:
  - Each change will be timestamped and added to the history of the concept
  - [Talk pages](./talk-pages.md) should be used that to discuss controversial changes to the concept, revisions, merges, and deletions
  - The `Status` property should be used to indicate whether the concept is ready for use in downstream services (eg classifiers, knowledge graph). This should be set to `Ready` when the concept is sufficiently accurate and complete.
- [Talk pages](./talk-pages.md) should also be used to provide concept definitions and labelling strategies in cases where the concept has an example-based classifier.
