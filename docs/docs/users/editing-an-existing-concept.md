# Editing an existing concept

On a concept page, you should see an `✏️ edit` button in the top right hand side of the item content

![](./images/edit-item.png)

This will allow you to change the preferred label, description, and alternative labels for the item. Make your changes, and hit `✅ save`. To abandon your changes, click `❌ cancel`.

If you choose to save your changes, they will automatically be added to the history of the item (see [Auditing a concept's history](./auditing-a-concepts-history.md))

## Editing statements

To add/delete statements on your item, see the [Adding relationships between concepts](./adding-relationships.md) documentation.

## Atomic edits

Try to keep your edits small! Making changes to the preferred label, description, and alternative labels all at once, or editing multiple statements will muddle the edit history of the item. Instead, try to make individual, atomic changes. Doing so will make it much easier for future users to understand the history of the item, and to revert part of a change without scrapping the parts which are still useful!
