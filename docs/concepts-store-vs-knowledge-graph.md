# Concept Store vs Knowledge Graph

Climate Policy Radar's <u>concept store</u> is a [Wikibase](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Wikibase) instance. It's used by the policy team to manage individual climate concepts and the relationships between them.

The <u>knowledge graph</u> is a superset of the concept store, which includes additional data and relationships that are not directly related to the concepts themselves. For example, the knowledge graph includes data about the relationships between concepts and the policy documents that mention them. It might also include targets

The concept store is effectively a [CMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system) for the knowledge graph, ie. it's a user-friendly interface for managing (some of) the data in the knowledge graph.
