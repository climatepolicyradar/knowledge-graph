# Hierarchy heuristics

We don't want to make things too hierarchical! We should lean more on "relatedness" than "hierarchy".

Reasons why:

1. **Hierarchies are hard to maintain**. blah
2. **Hierarchies are hard to use**. blah
3. **Hierarchies are hard to understand**. blah
4. **Hierarchies are prone to bias**. blah
