# Idealised workflow

- A policy team member would make additions to the Knowledge Graph based on their research:
  - Create a new concept “parent” (e.g. just transition)
  - Add new concept “children” linked to the parents (e.g. green jobs as part of just transition)
  - Add the textual representations or “elements” of these concepts to be identified in the text (e.g. Just Transition, Just Ecological Transition, green job, green jobs…)
  - Easily check whether the concepts or textual representations already exist within the Knowledge Graph and flag duplications
  - Easily add to any added child concepts or elements a relationship to any concepts that are already within the concept store outside of the concept that it has been added within
  - Check for typos or human error before submitting to the store
- The Head of Policy / appropriate team member would edit, deny or approve these additions to the concept store before they are finalised:
  - Additions can be recorded as “pending”, and then be approved or denied
  - Date of input and of approval would be recorded
  - Denial of an addition could be recorded outside of the store (e.g. Notion)
  - Talk can be recorded in the entry for a concept that is edited or approved
  - Permission for completion needs to be granted by the appropriate team member i.e. not everyone can immediately add and approve a concept
- The concept store would also house the methodology for the concept (e.g. explorer input, classifier methodology, and such)
  - Edits and additions to the methodologies could also be housed within the concept store
  - Tracked changes would also be visible between different versions of the methodologies
