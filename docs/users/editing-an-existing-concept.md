# Editing an existing concept

On a concept page, you should see an `✏️ edit` button in the top right hand side of the item content

![](./images/edit-item.png)

This will allow you to change the preferred label, description, and alternative labels for the item. Make your changes, and hit `✅ save`. To abandon your changes, click `❌ cancel`.

If you choose to save your changes, they will automatically be added to the history of the item (see [Auditing a concept's history](./auditing-a-concepts-history.md))

## Editing statements

To add/delete statements on your item, see the [Adding relationships between concepts](./adding-relationships.md) documentation.
