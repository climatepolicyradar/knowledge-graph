# Getting started with the concepts store

This is a guide to getting started with the concepts store as a front-end user. It's aimed at policy team members or external users who are new to wikibase (or our implementation of it).

After reading these pages, you should have a decent understanding of how the concepts store is structured, be able to create and edit concepts, and feel confident about how your edits will affect downstream services like concept pages, classifiers, and the knowledge graph.

The content here is divided into two main sections: (1) technical and (2) conceptual.
The technical content is about how to use the concepts store, while the conceptual stuff is about how to _think about_ the concepts store.

## Technical stuff

This technical content should give you a good grounding in how to use the concepts store. It's should give you a good idea of how to make your first edits.

The concepts store borrows a lot of ideas from wikidata, so if you get stuck, you might find answers in their [help pages](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Help:Contents). Make sure to add the answers you find to this documentation so that it's easier for the next person!

## Conceptual stuff

These pages should give you some heuristics for how to structure new concepts and relationships in a way that's useful for downstream services, while remaining consistent with the existing content! Remember, this is a guide, not a rulebook - if you have a good reason to go against this guidance (and have discussed it with the team), you should! The concepts store should be flexible enough to accommodate a massive range of ideas, and you probably have a better idea of what's useful than I do!
