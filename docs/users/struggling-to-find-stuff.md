#Â Struggling to find stuff

If you're adding to a concept and are struggling to find the right property or concept to link to via search, you've probably identified a gap in the names for the properties or concepts.

Usually, this is fixable by adding to the aliases/alternative names for the property or concept that you're looking for.

Plugging gaps like this is _not only_ a great way of helping out users of the concepts store, but will likely improve the performance of the classifiers which are built on the concepts store's data!

1. Find the actual concept/property you were looking for. NB: this might be a bit of a pain, but it's worth it! A good way of doing this if search isn't working, is to look for a concept which you know is related to the one you're looking for, and then click through to the concept page.
2. Click the `edit` button on the concept page.
3. Add the name you were searching for to the `aliases` field. This will make it easier for other users to find the concept in future, and should also improve the performance of our classifiers!
