> "as simple as possible, but no simpler!"

We're not aiming to build a perfect model of the world. We're aiming to build a _useful_ model of the world. It's easy to get lost in the details and try to build a model that is too complex.

We want to define concepts and relations which are useful to the users of CPR's tools, and nothing more.
