  - **A description:** A one or two sentence description of the concept, which could be used to disambiguate it from other, similar concepts.
  - **A list of aliases:** Alternative labels for the concept. These should be pipe separated, ie interspersed with the "|" character. For example, the concept `"Greenhouse gases"` might have aliases `"GHG | ghgs | greenhouse gas | green-house gases"` etc.
