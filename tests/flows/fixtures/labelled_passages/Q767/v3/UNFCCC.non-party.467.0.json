Colombia provided responses, in particular explaining that its national carbon tax is underpinned by a major implementation decree and has a good level of participation across sectors. The Party has made several improvements in the implementation of the national carbon tax, including strengthening the accountability rules to include other kinds of initiatives with a view to creating an internal market to promote the reduction of GHG emissions in the country. Regarding barriers to developing the national GHG inventory, Colombia stated that it has better data for developing emission factors and activity data as well as relevant institutional arrangements for the compilation of the GHG inventory, but needs to continue to work on these areas. Regarding factors affecting the deforestation rates, Colombia indicated that deforestation rates have decreased as a result of the implementation of its REDD+ strategy.
