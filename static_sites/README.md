This directory contains a few static site generators for visualizing stages in our concept development and evaluation process. The sites are hosted on AWS S3 and are generated by populating [jinja templates](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/).

Take a look at the individual project READMEs to understand how they're put together and how you can run them yourself.
