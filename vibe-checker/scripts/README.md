# Scripts for the vibe-checker

This directory contains scripts associated with the vibe-checker.

The scripts aren't used regularly, aren't tested or actively maintained, and thus you shouldn't expect them to work perfectly out of the box! However, they _should_ be useful for illustrating how to work with the vibe-checker, or as foundations for extending the ideas/data/codebase to other use cases.
