# üï∏Ô∏è Knowledge graph

Infrastructure, tools, and scripts for managing Climate Policy Radar's concept store and knowledge graph.

The concept store is a wikibase instance, used by the policy team to manage individual climate concepts and the relationships between them.

## Getting started

Documentation is available in the [docs](docs) directory, and mirrored at [labs.climatepolicyradar.org/knowledge-graph](https://labs.climatepolicyradar.org/knowledge-graph)

- Policy team members (and other contributors to the concept store) should refer to the [users](https://labs.climatepolicyradar.org/knowledge-graph/docs/users) section of the documentation
- Developers should refer to the [developers](docs/developers/) section of the documentation
