I'm using option one here, but leaving in the code for two, as it doesn't require you to bother the data science team for a data file.\n",

    "Either way, for these experiments, we're only really interested in a small subset, so loading the whole dataset, only to then subset it to a few dozen is sort of overkill. So at the end of this, I'll write the subset to a little csv to use instead (as long as create_new_sample is set to True).\n",
