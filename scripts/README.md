# Scripts

This directory contains scripts that are used to run various processes around the concept store / knowledge graph. Generally, they should be run from the root of the repository using `poetry run python scripts/<script_name>.py`, or using a specific `just` command (see [justfile](../justfile) for more details).

Individual scripts' docstrings contain more information about their purpose and usage.
